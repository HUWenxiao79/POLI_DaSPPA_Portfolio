Canals and rivers must ensure good navigation conditions, unhindered for example by water levels, for a minimum number of days per year.
Calls for more transhipment terminals, improved handling capacity at freight terminals, reduced waiting times at rail border crossings, longer trains to shift more freight onto cleaner transport modes, and the option for lorries to be transported by train network-wide. To ensure infrastructure planning meets real operational needs, it also creates nine ‘European Transport Corridors' that integrate rail, road, and waterways.

Specifically, the idea is to reimburse the costs of keeping airports open at the beginning of the Corona pandemic. During the lockdown in March and April, airports were kept open at the request of politicians despite the dramatic drop in passenger numbers - so that German tourists from abroad could be brought home and masks and medicines could be transported. In concrete terms, this involves a sum of 200 million euros from the federal government and the airports' holding costs from March to the end of June 2020. In addition, the federal government is putting around 400 million euros into the three airports with federal participation, in addition to Berlin, these are Munich and Cologne-Bonn. The preconditions for federal support are that the respective federal states provide a subsidy in the same amount, that no dividends are distributed for 2020 and that no bonuses are paid to managing directors and board members of the operating companies. In addition, the Federal Government will support small airports in connection with air navigation services. To this end, a second charging area supported with federal funds is to be created for aerodromes that do not belong to those under § 27d para. 1 of the Air Traffic Act, but where air navigation services are recognised as necessary. Up to now, small airports have borne the costs of air traffic control themselves and cannot always pass them on to airspace users. 20 million euros have been earmarked for this support measure in the 2021 budget. DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung GmbH (air navigation services) will receive equity support of €300 million in 2021.

The reduction of charges will be available to (i) energy-intensive companies and (ii) shore-side electricity supply to ships while at berth in ports. The scheme is part of the German Renewable Energy Act (“Erneuerbare Energien Gesetz” - ‘EEG 2021'). The scheme will help Germany reach its renewable energy targets without unduly distorting competition and will contribute to the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality by 2050. Payments under the scheme for 2021 have been estimated to amount to around €33.1 billion. Beneficiaries will generally receive support via a sliding premium on top of the electricity market price, with the exception of very small installations, which will be eligible to receive feed-in tariffs. Moreover, in the majority of cases, beneficiaries will be selected through competitive bidding processes. In particular, tenders are organised per technology, including a newly introduced separation of rooftop and ground based solar photovoltaic, and separate tenders for biomethane. Moreover, innovation tenders for projects spanning several technologies will also be organised, allowing for a certain degree of technological neutrality and to gather experience on how to make electricity production from RES installations less intermittent. Finally, as biomass and onshore wind tenders have been regularly undersubscribed in the past, the EEG 2021 contains clear safeguards for tenders to be competitive, therefore unfolding their full potential to avoid overcompensation and to keep costs to a minimum for consumers and taxpayers. Rules to sell electricity in line with market signals have also been further improved in the EEG 2021.","https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2042 (accessed 3 May 2021)",

The implementation of climate projects will begin next year. Starting from 2023, Russia plans to launch a system of mandatory carbon reporting for enterprises.""",29/10/2021,29/10/2021,RUB,0,0,0,0,"""The strategy includes two scenarios – inertial and target (intensive). The target scenario is taken as a basis. The scenarios differ in sets of measures to decarbonize the Russian economy.
The macroeconomic conditions of the target scenario assume a faster growth rate of non-energy exports - up to 4.4% annually. The contribution to the sustainable growth of the economy will be made by both the outpacing growth rates of investments in fixed assets (3.7% annually) and the stable growth of real disposable income (2.5% annually). At the same time, a more moderate drop in energy exports from 2030 is expected than in the inertial scenario, including due to the reorientation to high-value-added products and the implementation of measures to increase the competitiveness of Russian energy exports in foreign markets. As a result, the annual growth rates of the economy remain above the global average until 2050 (up to 3% per year), the Cabinet of Ministers emphasizes.
The implementation of the target scenario will require investments in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the amount of about 1% of GDP in 2022-2030 and up to 1.5-2% of GDP in 2031-2050. Among the decarbonization measures announced are the provision of support measures for the introduction, replication and scaling of low- and carbon-free technologies, promotion of the use of secondary energy resources, changes in tax, customs and budget policies, the development of green financing, measures to preserve and increase the absorption capacity of forests and other ecosystems, support for technologies for capturing, using and disposing of greenhouse gases.
Thus, within the framework of the target scenario, economic growth will be possible with a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions: by 2050 by 60% from the level of 2019 and by 80% from the level of 1990. Further implementation of this scenario will allow Russia to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.

The main measures are:
-Lower the Special Electricity Tax (IEE) from 5.1% to 0.5% (minim required by the European regulation)
-Increase the contribution from the collection of CO2 auctions directed to cover the costs of the electricity system from the € 1,100 million budgeted in 2021 to € 2,000 million.
-Temporarily decrease the extraordinary income which is provoking the high price of gas in some power plants that do not emit on the wholesale market.
-Establish a Minimum Vital Energy Supply which prohibits the cut off of supply due to non-payment to the beneficiaries of the Social Electricity Bonus.
-Limit the growth of the gas tariff (TUR) during one semester.
-Creation of a new mechanism in order to promote the long-term electricity contracting.","https://www.miteco.gob.es/es/prensa/ultimas-noticias/detalle_noticias.aspx?tcm=tcm:30-530707 (Accessed 20 September 2021)

This aims at keeping bills as low as possible, driving the UK towards its goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and helping turn the UK into the ‘Silicon Valley’ of energy.
The fund, which opens for application on 31st August, is part of Ofgem’s RII02 price controls for the electricity system operator and the network companies that operate GB’s energy pipes and wires. The fund will be approved by Ofgem and managed in partnership with Innovate UK.
£450 million will initially become available over the next five years through the fund, with the option to increase in response to need and if innovators bring forward strong plans. Together, network companies, system operators, and the world’s leading businesses and researchers will use this money to drive big ideas that accelerate the transition to an emissions-free energy system and at the same time help to position the UK as a world leader in energy innovation. 
To apply for the first round of funding, network companies must address four major strategic challenges that are crucial for the energy transition. These are:
- Whole system integration
- Data and digitalisation
- Heat
- Transport
Projects could range from ensuring the networks are ready to roll out clean heating solutions such as heat pumps to Britain’s homes to developing ways for network companies to work together across transmission, distribution, system operation, gas and electricity. Projects could also include developing new technologies for networks to support flexible energy solutions, such as battery storage technology, to ensure electricity is used and stored more effectively, thereby bringing down bills and emissions. Ideas need to be big, bold and ambitious with potential to scale across the networks upon completion.",,

The measure will help Poland reach its renewable energy targets without unduly distorting competition. Poland notified the Commission of its intention to introduce a new scheme to support offshore wind farms. Offshore wind technology is at an initial stage in Poland. The aid will be granted in the form of a two-way contract-for-difference premium, during 25 years, but only up to 100,000 full load hours per MegaWatt of installed capacity. Under this model, this variable premium is calculated as the difference between the reference price and the market price for electricity. When the market price is below the reference price, beneficiaries will be entitled to receive payments equal to the difference between the two prices. However, when the market price is above the reference price, beneficiaries will have to pay the difference between the two prices to the State. The scheme will roll out in two phases. During the first phase of the scheme, offshore projects will be granted aid using the exception to the auction requirement, due to the existence of a very limited number of projects. The reference price for projects in the first phase will be administratively fixed based on their costs, with a maximum set at 319,60 PLN/MWh (€71,82/MWh). After obtaining the environmental permit which will fix the final technical characteristics of the project, each project will submit an individual notification with a business plan to the Commission. Based on the respective business plan, the Commission will assess individually the specific level of operating aid. Under the second phase of the scheme, aid will be granted through open and competitive auctions which will be organised as of 2025, and the reference price of projects will be fixed based on the respective bid. The scheme has a total maximum budget of €22.5 billion and will run until 2030.","https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_2567 (accessed 23 May 2021); , https://www.gov.pl/web/klimat/komisja-europejska-zatwierdzila-polski-system-wsparcia-dla-morskich-farm-wiatrowych (accessed 23 May 2021)",

The scheme will link up housing providers and builders through all stages of home retrofitting, from planning through to large-scale delivery. This will dramatically increase the pace of projects that upgrade cold, damp housing stock to homes fit for the future. The partnership has the potential value of £10 billion in retrofit works, which would create around 150,000 jobs over the decade. The Innovation Partnership is open to social housing providers across the UK, with at least £5 billion estimated that could be spent in London.
As a key part of the Mayor’s target of reaching net zero by 2030, he is also seizing the opportunity for more solar energy on London’s rooftops.

The project shall improve availability of fertilizer to farmers thereby boosting development of eastern region and will save transport subsidy for supply of urea in eastern part of the country. It would assist in reducing Urea imports to the tune of 12.7 LMT per annum leading to savings in foreign exchange.

The project will also give a boost to 'Make in India' initiative and AtmaNirbhar' campaign and would help development of infrastructure like roads, railways water, etc. providing major boost to economy in the eastern part of the country including promoting ancillary industry. The project will also provide New business opportunity in form of ancillary industries in the catchment area of the project.

Coal gasification plants are strategically important as coal prices are non-volatile and coal is abundantly available.  Talcher plant shall also reduce dependence on important Natural Gas for production of urea leading to reduction in LNG import bill.

The first phase of the investment corresponds to USD 3.5 billion and is reported as such here. The volume of gas resources in the field is estimated at 200 trillion cubic feet of rich raw gas, which will provide a valuable feedstock for the petrochemical industries.

The Company expects the field’s production, to commence early 2024, to reach approximately 2.2 billion standard cubic feet per day of sales gas by 2036, with an associated approximately 425 million standard cubic feet per day of ethane, representing about 40 percent of current production. The Company also expects the field to produce approximately 550 thousand barrels per day of gas liquids and condensates.

Development of the field over 22 years should provide the government a net income of about 32 billion riyals annually and contribute 75 billion riyals to the kingdom’s gross domestic product according to the Saudi press Agency.

Aramco is keen on developing domestic gas production in order to shift from crude oil to gas exports and to use gas domestially for power generation and as an industrial feedstock.","https://www.aramco.com/en/news-media/news/2020/jafurah-gas-field

New legislation aims to tackle “premature obsolescence” in electrical goods – short lifespans built into appliances by manufacturers so that customers have to buy new ones sooner – and make them more energy efficient.
The rules include a legal requirement on manufacturers to make spare parts available to consumers, which aims to extend the lifespan of products by up to 10 years and cut carbon emissions from the manufacture of new goods.
The measures, which apply to white goods such as washing machines, dishwashers and fridges, as well as items such as TVs, aim to reduce the 1.5m tonnes of electrical waste the UK generates a year.
New energy labels have also been introduced this week, to simplify the ratings, which had reached the point where most products were classed as A+, A++ or A+++ because of improvements in energy efficiency since the standards were first introduced. The simplified system is based on an A-G scale, with the bar raised for each grade so that very few appliances will now be classed in the top A standard.

The Strategy includes 10 lines of action and 66 measures that address aspects such as the participation of storage in the energy system, the circular economy or energy communities to generate spaces for citizen participation; the promotion of renewable hydrogen, the development of new business models such as the second life of batteries, the training of professionals to deepen the Just Transition, the use of storage as a basis for technological development in islands and isolated areas, to R + D + i, promoting employment, or the elimination of administrative barriers to facilitate initiatives and projects.
The projects carried out as part of the Strategy will be financed through the Recovery and Resilience Mechanism (Next Generation European Funds), other European funds (Innovation Fund, Horizon, European Green Deal, ERDF, InvestEU, etc.) and by national mechanisms such as the R + D + i aid instruments managed by CDTI or other aid instruments managed by IDAE or AEI.
Energy storage contributes to the management of electricity networks, encourages citizen participation in changing the energy model and allows greater competition and integration in the electricity market. In addition, it contributes to the generation of employment, economic recovery, the strengthening of the national industry, the development of R + D + i and the improvement of opportunities in the Just Transition areas.

It increases the Additional Income Tax (AIT) on hydrocarbon extraction. The measure was passed in parallel with the so called ""completion of the tax manouvre"" of the upstream oil and gas sector, initiated several years ago, and adoption of some additional tax benefits for the upstream oil and gas industry in 2020 (e.g. Federal Laws #65, #340). So the cumulative effect is mixed. Independent estimates of the increased tax burden on the oil and gas extractive industry vary. For example, the Renaissance capital puts it at at RUB 260 billion for 2021, equivalent to 3.3% of the government’s tax take in 2019 from the Russian oil and gas sector. The tax burden is expected to increase mainly on LUKOIL, Surgutneftegaz and Tatneft, while ""national champions"" Rosneft and, to a lesser extent, Gazprom secured additional tax benefits in 2020 that help to mitigate the impact of these Tax Code Amendments.

The source of funding is the Operational Program Infrastructure and Environment 2014-2020, sub-measure 1.6.1. MPEC in Nowy Sącz is the operator of a system that includes energy sources and a heat network for city residents, public institutions, and companies. The planned project involves the construction of a gas boiler for the production of thermal energy to meet year-round heat demand in Nowy Sącz. A modern high-efficiency cogeneration system powered by natural gas will produce 5.85 MW of heat and 6 MW of electricity per year. Greenhouse gas emissions are expected to decrease by approx. 31,496 tons of CO2 / year and primary energy consumption by 171,375 GJ / year. Limiting the use of hard coal is a key goal. The contract for co-financing the construction was signed in Warsaw on December 29, 2020 by the Vice-President of the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management and the President of the Management Board of Miejskie Przedsiębiorstwo Energetyki Cieplnej Sp. z o. o. in Nowy Sącz.

The European Commission launched in 2008 the Covenant of Mayors, an initiative open to all cities and municipalities in Europe with the aim of involving local authorities and citizens in the development and implementation of the energy policy of the European Union. Following the success of the Covenant of Mayors, in 2014 the Mayors' Adapt initiative was launched, based on the same public management model, inviting cities to make political commitments and take measures to anticipate the inevitable effects of climate change.
On October 15, 2015, the European Commission launched the Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy, merging previous initiatives. This new tool aims to bring together the mayors of European cities in a permanent information exchange network for the application of good practices: improve energy efficiency in urban areas, achieve a reduction in CO2 emissions in the local territory and increase resilience to climate change.
The Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy consists of the commitment of the signatory municipalities to accomplish the objectives of the European Union for the year 2030  and reduce CO2 emissions in their territory by at least 40% through energy efficiency measures and a greater use of renewable energy sources, working in turn on the implementation of measures to adapt to climate change and increase resilience against it, as well as increased cooperation with the Similar local and regional authorities in the EU and beyond to improve access to safe, sustainable and affordable energy.

It was adopted by the Sejm (Parliament) 17 Dec. 2020. The new regulations will significantly facilitate the use of the wind energy potential in the Baltic Sea and the development of Polish companies from the maritime economy sector. It is anticipated that the support for investors will be granted for a period of 25 years. The new act introduces a number of improvements. Administrative and legal procedures have been simplified, reducing the time in which investors can implement investments in offshore wind farms. In the first phase of the system's operation, for farms with a total capacity of 5.9 GW, support will be granted by way of an administrative decision by the President of the Energy Regulatory Office. The possibility of entering this system ends on June 30, 2021. In the following years, support will be granted in the formula of competitive auctions. The second auction is expected to take place in 2025 and the third in 2027, leading to a total of 5 GW of additional capacity built. A tax will also be included in the act; offshore wind is not subject to a real estate tax. The new act provides that investors will be required to conduct a dialogue with potential suppliers of materials and services for the implementation of offshore wind farms. Polish companies will therefore have the opportunity to become part of the supply chain of services and technologies necessary for the operation of offshore wind farms. The Ministry of Climate and Environment predicts that the new regulations will encourage investors and accelerate the process of transformation of the Polish energy sector into zero-emission energy sources. After 2020, Poland, as well as other EU Member States, are required to generate at least 15% of electricity from renewable sources. Though it was envisioned that the law would come into effect Jan. 1, 2021, the Senate Special Committee for Climate Affairs will only get to this issue in early Jan. If there will be no amendments to the law, the President could sign it by mid-Jan., allowing the law to come into effect by Feb. On 13 Jan. 2021, the Senate unanimously supported the bill, sending it for approval to the President. On Jan. 22, 2021, the President signed the new act, signalling a move towards low-emission and zero-emission electricity.

These establishments will act as intermediaries between the public administration and the beneficiaries of the subsidy, and will present the requests for assistance.
These grants from the Generalitat are up to 250 euros in the case of electric bicycles (whose amount may not exceed 1,400 euros), 75 euros for non-electrified ones (whose maximum price will be 500 euros) and also 75 euros for electric scooters (whose cost may not exceed 450 euros). The aid can also be applied to the installation of electrification kits, with an amount of up to 200 euros (the maximum price of the kit is set at 600 euros) or to the purchase of bicycles with cargo elements for child transport, in which case the grants will be 150 euros (in this case the price of the family bicycle may not exceed 700 euros).

It accounts for 9% of the total resources and it is intended to move the economy towards a clear, stable and predictable normative framework which promotes private investment and renewable energies by developing a new auction system and support lines for innovative projects, with a clear commitment to floating offshore wind power.
The concrete measures regarding the energy transition are: Massive deployment of the renewable generation park aimed at energy development, electrical infrastructures, promotion of smart grids and deployment of flexibility and storage, roadmap for renewable hydrogen and its sectoral integration and Just Transition Strategy.
The Plan will be financed by the European Recovery Fund, but the Government has decided to advance in the next General State Budgets 27,000 million euros to this Plan. This will allow the execution of the Plan to be accelerated from the moment the State General Budgets are approved. Specifically, the European Recovery Fund will allow Spain to obtain financing for up to 140,000 million of which around 72,000 million will be disbursed in the form of transfers and the rest through loans.
The European Recovery Fund consists of two instruments through which resources will be channelled: on the one hand, the Facility for Recovery and Resilience, which concentrates the bulk with 59,000 million in transfers, and on the other hand, the REACT-EU that allows our country to obtain financing for an amount of 12,400 million. 
Some of the specific call of aids of these Components of the Plan have already been approved:
-Aids for energy self-consumption, storage and air conditioning systems (Royal Decree 477/2021): initial budget of 600million € expandable to 1,320 million €.

The law paves the way for a EUR 40 billion support programme for the economic transformation of coal regions and legislation to compensate coal plant operators for shutting down capacity. In particular, the Act stipulates that a total of EUR 4.35 billion in compensation will be paid for the planned shutdowns by 2030 (see separate entry in the Tracker). Further, the government would introduce adaptation payments for older workers in lignite mines and hard coal and lignite power plants who lose their jobs due to the coal exit plans, with a budget of up to EUR 5 billion by 2048. The Coal Phase-Out Act was passed 18 months after the issue of multi-stakeholder Coal Exit Commission's recommendations, so it has its roots well before the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis and government responses to it.

The deal is part of Germany’s effort to completely wean off coal by no later than 2038 and  covers a total of 4.35 billion euros in payments to utilities, which will also waive any rights for future lawsuits if they sign it. RWE and Leag (owned 50-50% owned by Czech energy group EPH and private equity group PPF Investments), are by far the largest operators of lignite, or brown coal, power plants and mines in Germany.
The Coal Phase Out Act (Gesetz zur Reduzierung und zur Beendigung der Kohleverstromung und zur Änderung weiterer Gesetze (Kohleausstiegsgesetz)) passed on 3 July 2020 (see separate entry) underlies the plan to phase out coal by 2038. The Act stipulates that a total of EUR 4.35 billion in compensation will be paid for the planned shutdowns by 2030. Western German power company RWE will receive EUR 2.6 billion for shutting down its plants by the end of 2029. EUR 1.75 billion will go to operations in the eastern German district Lusatia, run by the Lausitz Energie Kraftwerk AG (LEAG). Part of the money will not go to LEAG itself but to a trustee confirmed by the government. The compensation does not change in case the operators shut down plants earlier than planned. The Coal Phase Out Act was passed 18 months after the issue of multi-stakeholder Coal Exit commission Recommendations, so it has its roots well before the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis and government responses to it. However, this measure is included in the Tracker as a new policy that involves a significant public expenditure. It is classified as ""fossil conditional"" because, despite the end goal of phasing out coal, it pays the polluters. The law was passed by both chambers of the Parliament on 3 July. As of 28 July, the Coal Phase Out Act was still awaiting signature of the Federal President, upon which it will enter into force the next day.","https://uk.reuters.com/article/germany-coal-compensation/german-government-approves-lignite-compensation-contract-idUKL8N2IV4SI Accessed 4 January 2021","https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-germany-politics-climate-change/german-cabinet-backs-43-billion-euros-for-utilities-over-brown-coal-phase-out-idUKKBN23V21M Accessed 4 January 2021
