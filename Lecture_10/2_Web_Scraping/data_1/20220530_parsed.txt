      Moving Steadily Forward Along Path to Normalcy
              Amid Stabilised COVID-19 Epidemic
      Having gone through the turbulent time in early March and
seen the arrival of dawn in April, the fifth wave of the epidemic
was clearly under control in May with the daily number of cases
tested positive hovering between 200 and 300. Nonetheless, to
create favourable conditions for quarantine-free travel with the
Mainland, the Government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) has been steadfastly
implementing the strategy of “preventing the importation of cases
and the resurgence of domestic infections” and striving to reduce
deaths, severe cases and infections, while encouraging members
of the public to receive appropriate COVID-19 vaccine doses in
a timely manner to build a stronger city-wide protection barrier
against the virus. The community can thus be enabled to move
steadily forward along a more promising path to normalcy.
Epidemic development
      Over the past few weeks, the daily reported number of cases
tested positive remained at a low but stagnant level. Neither did
the figure continue to drop drastically, nor did it rise considerably
despite some infection clusters found. For our peace of mind,
generally low-level figures were observed in May in other
monitoring indicators, including the viral load in sewage
surveillance tests, the percentage of positive cases found in
restriction-testing declaration operations and the percentage of
positive cases from tests conducted at the community level, as
well as the real-time effective reproductive number for local cases
and COVID-19 point-prevalence rate released by the School of
Public Health under The University of Hong Kong.

      The drop in confirmed cases, coupled with the multi-tiered
triage and treatment strategy in effect, has enabled the public
healthcare system to resume its normal operation. The number
of COVID-19 confirmed cases admitted to public hospitals
significantly decreased from 1 339 on May 1 to 427 on May 29.
Of the latter, eight were in serious conditions and 13 were in
critical conditions (four thereof under intensive care).
Getting society back to normal
      As the epidemic situation remains stable, and the COVID-
19 vaccination rates of the first and second doses have reached
92% and 86.9% respectively with the risk of severe or death cases
effectively reduced among the infected, the HKSAR Government
has relaunched social and economic activities on various fronts in
an orderly manner along the path to normalcy as announced in
March 21 and in response to the expectations from various sectors
of society. It is particularly gratifying to see that all students
city-wide have resumed face-to-face classes at school; the Hong
Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination this year has
been conducted successfully; sports premises have been
reopened; all scheduled premises subject to regulation have
resumed business; and the catering and retail sectors have reaped
a long-awaited blooming business.            As regards visitors’
immigration, further to lifting the flight ban on nine countries in
April to allow Hong Kong residents (HKRs) from overseas to
enter Hong Kong, the HKSAR Government expanded the scope
to non-HKRs with effect from May 1 alongside suitable
adjustments made to the route-specific flight suspension
mechanism. With effect from May 9, the HKSAR Government
imposed an additional rapid antigen test (RAT) requirement on
“test-and-hold” at the airport to strengthen the testing
arrangement for inbound passengers on the one hand, while
shortening their waiting time at the airport to enhance the process
of closed-loop management from the airport to designated
quarantine hotels on the other.

Implementing third stage of Vaccine Pass as planned
      It has been over 450 days since the launch of the COVID-
19 Vaccination Programme by the HKSAR Government. No
shortage of the two COVID-19 vaccines for the people of Hong
Kong has ever occurred, while a growing number of channels for
vaccination has been provided to bring them more convenience.
At present, as many as 100 000 doses can be administered daily,
which can well meet the demand. While the first- and second-
dose vaccination rates of Hong Kong’s population are
satisfactory, the third-dose one has just exceeded 50% and needs
to be boosted further. With the second stage of the Vaccine Pass
coming into effect on April 30, the HKSAR Government will
implement the third stage from May 31 onwards as planned.
People will be then generally required to have received three
doses before they can enter a series of premises subject to
regulation.
      In order to strengthen the immune barrier for hospitals and
public healthcare facilities, protect members of the public using
public healthcare services (especially the elderly and chronic
patients) and further encourage them to get vaccinated, the
Vaccine Pass arrangement will be implemented by administrative
means in designated healthcare premises under the purview of the
Food and Health Bureau, the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority (HA) (such as specialist out-patient clinics of
HA, Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment
Centres, District Health Centres) with effect from June 13.

Supporting enterprises and safeguarding jobs
       The HKSAR Government announced in May that the
seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for February to April this
year stood at 5.4%, representing a 0.4 percentage point increase
as compared with the preceding three-month period.
Nonetheless, the subsiding local epidemic situation and
progressive relaxation of social distancing measures, together
with the 2022 Employment Support Scheme (2022 ESS) and new
round of electronic consumption vouchers of $10,000 each to
eligible citizens as announced in the Government Budget this
year, would expectedly give a boost to the business of various
sectors by and large. It is hoped that enterprises could regain
vitality and retain staff or even hire more, improving the business
sentiment and promoting economic rebound.
       Earlier on, the HKSAR Government rolled out the fifth and
sixth rounds of the Anti-epidemic Fund to provide some financial
                                   7

relief to the enterprises and practitioners of various trades affected
directly or indirectly by the fifth wave of the epidemic, as well as
to the frontline personnel having contributed to anti-epidemic
efforts such as cleansing workers.           As at May 25, over
$14 billion was disbursed. The 2022 ESS, which comes with a
wider coverage, met with overwhelming response. By the
deadline of May 12, applications from 176 000 employers
(involving about 1.66 million employees) and 119 000 self-
employed persons were received. They are being processed in
batches. As at May 25, the wage subsidies of May were
approved for 77 000 employers, involving $5.2 billion. These
employers had committed to employ about 665 000 people in
May; and a one-off subsidy of $8,000 was approved for about
64 000 self-employed persons, involving over $0.5 billion.
Moving steadily forward along path to normalcy
        The COVID-19 epidemic has been raging across the globe
for nearly two and a half years. Hong Kong has not been spared
and has met with five waves of the epidemic, of which the latest
one triggered by the highly transmissible Omicron mutant strain
has overwhelmed our anti-epidemic capacity.                     While
progressing along the path to normalcy, we should feel gratified,
and most grateful, for the timely assistance from the Central
Government and full co-operation by society at large. This is
the 28th monthly report on our anti-epidemic efforts, also the last
one in a row, issued by me as the Chief Executive of the HKSAR.
I wish Hong Kong steady strides continuously along the hard-
earned path to normalcy, resuming cross-boundary people flows
in an orderly manner early and reinvigorating the status as Asia’s
world city connecting East and West, and new heights scaled
therewith under “One Country, Two Systems”.
