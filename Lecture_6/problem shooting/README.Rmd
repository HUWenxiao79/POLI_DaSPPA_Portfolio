## Trouble-Shooting Tips

What should you do if things go wrong?

-   Identify the problem: Read messages from R

-   Locate the problem: Where does it occur?

    -   Clear, clear, clear

    -   Run your code *from the start* and check where it breaks

-   Seek assistance

    -   Search engine (Google, Bing)

    -   Large Language Model (e.g., *ChatGPT*)

    -   Human (e.g., me)

## Read Error Messages

-   You have not loaded your data.

```{r, error = TRUE}
d
```

-   You have not loaded your package.

```{r, error = TRUE}
d <- read_csv("vdem_1984_2022_external.csv")
```

## The First Things to Check

When you start coding, here are the first things to check:

-   Have you loaded the data you need?

<!-- -->

-   Have you loaded the packages you need?

Note:

-   *R console* and *Render* are two [separate]{.underline} systems.

-   That things work in one of them does not guarantee they work in the other.

## Other Messages: Loading Packages

When you load a package, the printed output shows you information about the package.

```{r}
library(tidyverse) 
```

## Other Messages: Loading Data

```{r}
d <- read_csv("_DataPublic_/vdem/1984_2022/vdem_1984_2022_external.csv")
```

## Aside: Where to Place Your Data Files

Recap of my previous advice

-   Start an R project

-   In Rmarkdown, evaluate code chunks in the document from the project directory\
    ![](images/Screenshot%202023-10-11%20at%2020.14.44.png){width="299"}

-   **Open** the R project ***every time*** you continue working on it

-   How to open the R project?

    -   File --\> "Open Project"

    -   Click the `.Rproj` file in your R project folder.

## Aside: Where to Place Your Data Files

-   How to know that you are working from the project?

    -   Execute `getwd()` and it is the path of your project

    -   DO NOT use `setwd()` to force R to set a working directory *ad hoc*.

-   Why use an R project

    -   Better organization

    -   **Relative path:** However you move your project folder, as long as the *relative* locations of different files remain the same, your code will work.

    -   Replicability

## Locate the Problem: Clear, clear, clear

What may happen:

-   You get an error message but can't figure why

-   You don't get an error message but just can't knit the document.

Why? Your current *Environment* is filled with trash!

Solution: [Clear]{.underline} and [start over]{.underline}

## Locate the Problem: Clear, clear, clear

-   Do not save your *Environment* to a `.Rdata` file. If it is already saved. Delete it!

-   Set your project preference so that Rstudio remember not to save your *Environment*.

-   Frequently **clear** your Environment and start over

    -   to avoid confusion

    -   to mimic how your code will run in the *Render* environment.

## Locate the Problem: Clear, clear, clear

-   Make sure your environment is completely empty

-   To empty the environment

    -   Method 1: Execute `rm(list = ls())` in the *Console*

    -   Method 2: Click the broomstick in the *Environment* panel

    -   Method 3: Close and restart Rstudio

-   Differences between the three methods: 1 and 2 clear loaded *objects* but *not packages*. Loaded packages remain in your R console. 3 clear loaded objects, packages, and free up memory. Consider Method 3 a "deep clean."

## Locate the Problem: Run Your Program

-   "**Run All Chunks Above**" and "**Run All**" are handy tools.

    ![](images/Screenshot%202023-10-11%20at%2018.10.42.png){width="186"}

-   The program will run until error occurs.

-   Where the error occurs is where you should double-check carefully.

## Seek Assistance: Search Engine

-   "R" + package name (e.g., `tidyverse`) + function's name

-   Include the error message

    -   Remove the part that is specific to your case (file name, object name)

    -   **Example:** Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object ~~'d'~~ not found

    -   **Example:** Error in read_csv~~("vdem_1984_2022_external.csv"):~~ could not find function

## Seek Assistance: Large Language Model

-   Similar to search engine: Clearly indicate the programming language, package, function's name, and the error message.

-   Doesn't harm to start with pasting your whole chunk of code and ask the model to find mistakes for you.

## Seek Assistance: Human

-   Provide a description of the problem using a similar way with the previous approach: package name, function, and error message.

-   Provide the part of code where error occurs.

-   Preferably, make your code replicable.

    -   Make it in a way that the person who tries to assist you can **copy** the code to their R, run it, and see the problem.

    -   It uses some data? Include some toy/ example data. It can come from the data you are working on. Or you can use some of R's default datasets.

## Seek Assistance: Human

Example: [A (very well-written) question](#0) on CampusWire about `geom_dotplot` could have been asked with the following example by R's default dataset `mtccars`:

```{r, fig.height=2, fig.width=10}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg)) +
  geom_dotplot(method="histodot", binwidth = 1.5)
```

## Seek Assistance: Human

Then, the person who gives an answer copy the code to their R, suggest changes, and send the code back.

```{r, fig.height=2, fig.width=10}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg)) +
  geom_dotplot(method="histodot", binwidth = 0.8) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank())
```

## Tips

-   The "clean and start over" strategy helps more than you would expect.

-   If you don't get any relevant answer, it is rarely the case that the problem you get is unique. It is more likely that you have asked the wrong question.

-   Do not code for long hours

    -   It will be counter-productive.

    -   You will get grumpy and dizzy.

## One more thing...

These slides are made with Rmarkdown.
